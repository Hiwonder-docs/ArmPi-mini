## 1.3 Introduction to Raspberry Pi 5

Raspberry Pi, known as "**树莓派**" in Chinese, abbreviated as RPi or RasPi/RPI. It is a credit-card sized computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the UK. It is hoped that it can help children worldwide to learn programming and understand how computers work. The Raspberry Pi can connect to a keyboard, mouse, and Internet cable. It also features a TV output interface for analog video signals and an HDMI high-definition video output interface. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing and to learn how to program in languages like Python. And it is capable of doing everything you'd expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

**1.3.1 Brief Introduction of Raspberry Pi 5**

Raspberry Pi 5 features a 64-bit quad-core Cortex A76 processor with 2.4 GHz operating frequency. Compared to the Raspberry Pi 4, the CPU performance has increased by 2 to 3 times. Apart from the significant improvement in graphics performance with the 800MHz VideoCore VII GPU, it also supports dual 4Kp60 display output via HDMI, and advanced camera through restructuring Raspberry Pi Image Signal Processor. It provides consumers with a smooth desktop experience and opens up new applications for industrial customers.

This is the first full-sized Raspberry Pi computer, utilizing chips built internally by Raspberry Pi. RP1 provides the majority of the I/O functions for Raspberry Pi 5 and achieves a significant leap in peripheral performance and functionality. The total USB bandwidth has more than doubled, thus speeding up the transfer rate to external UAS drives and other high-speed peripherals. The dedicated dual-channel 1Gbps MIPI camera and display interface on earlier models have been replaced by a pair of quad-channel 1.5Gbps MIPI transceivers, tripling the total bandwidth and supporting a maximum of two cameras or displays in any combination. By supporting SDR104 high-speed mode, the peak performance of the SD card is doubled. This platform introduces a single-channel PCI Express 2.0 interface for the first time, providing support for high-bandwidth peripherals.

## 1.8 Deviation Adjustment

If the deviation of the servo main shaft is caused by the fall of the robot arm during assembly, or the replacement servo, and other operations, the generated deviation must be adjusted. Deviation is divided into two cases: small deviation and large deviation. Depending on the situation, the debugging method is also different.

**1.8.1 Preparation**

(1) Turn on ArmPi mini according to the tutorial in "[**1.6 Charging and Power-On Status Explanation**](#anchor_1_6)".

(2) Connect the robot via VNC remote tool according to "[**1.7 Remote Desktop Installation and Connection**](#anchor_1_7)".

**1.8.2 Deviation Judgment**

(1) Aftering connecting ArmPi mini, open PC software. 

(2) Then click **"Reset servo"** in the software interface, and then the robot arm will stand up straight.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_5/image2.png"  alt="loading" />

(3) Then click **"Read deviation"** to synchronize the deviation to the left servo control area.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_5/image3.png"  alt="loading" />

(4) After resetting robotic arm, the main shaft screws of servo ID3-ID5 are in a straight line (it is named as **"centerline"** in the following steps), as the figure shown below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_5/image4.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(5) The the groove line of the U shape bracket of ID6 servo are parallel with the edge of the upper cover of the base, as the left figure shown below, and the gripper is closed, as the right figure show below. Under this situation, the robotic arm is ready to use, you can skip this lesson.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_5/image5.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(6) If the angle between centerline and servo is less than 13 degrees, it is classified as small deviation and can be adjusted by PC software. You can follow the operation instruction in "[**1.8.3 Small Deviation Adjustment**](#anchor_1_8_3)" to adjust the small deviation. Here i will take ID3 servo as example, as the figure shown below. 

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_5/image7.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(7) If the angle between center line and servo is larger than 13 degree, it is classified as large deviation and can not be adjusted by PC software which the extreme adjustment value is between -150 and +150. Under this situation, you can follow the operation instruction in "[**1.8.4 Large Deviation Adjustment**](#anchor_1_8_4)" to adjust large deviation.

## 1.9 MAP Placement

<p id="anchor_6_1"></p>

**1.9.1 Map Layout Instruction**

* **Map Layout Instruction**

From the image below, we can know that map consists of four areas, which are robot placement area, picking area, sorting area and stacking area.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image2.png"  alt="loading" />

Place ArmPi mini in the placement area, and place colored blocks in the picking area.
After the color sorting is started, robot arm will pick the blocks in robot placement area, and place them in color sorting area. (About color sorting, please go to folder "[**Quick User Experience ->2.2 App Control**](https://docs.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi_mini/en/latest/docs/2_play_first_hand.html#app-control)" and "[**AI Vision Learning -> 4.5 Color Sorting**](https://docs.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi_mini/en/latest/docs/8_ai_vision.html#color-sorting)")
After the intelligent stacking is started, robot arm will pick the colored blocks in picking area and place them in stacking area. (About intelligent stacking, please go to folder "[**Quick User Experience ->2.2 APP Control**](https://docs.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi_mini/en/latest/docs/2_play_first_hand.html#app-control)" and "[**AI Vision Learning->4.6 Intelligent Stacking**](https://docs.hiwonder.com/projects/ArmPi_mini/en/latest/docs/8_ai_vision.html#intelligent-stacking)")

**1.9.2 Map Placement**

(1) Put map in a flat and smooth surface and glue four corners of the map to avoid map movement when starting game.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image3.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(2) Place the robotic arm in the placement area, and the base board must overlap the three blacks line on map ,as the figure shown below.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image4.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image5.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(3) After placement, gently press on the suction cups better adhere to the desktop.

:::{Note}
When starting color sorting and intelligent stacking, do not have similar color object within the frame to avoid interference.

**1.9.3 Position Calibration**

Before starting game, the picking position of gripper must be calibrated, otherwise the robot may fail to pick object and affect the normal use.

* **Preparation**

(1) Turn on ArmPi mini according to the tutorial "[**1.6 Charging and Power-On Status Explanation**](#anchor_1_6)".

(2) Connect robot via VNC remote tool according to the tutorial "[**1.7 Remote Desktop Installation and Connection**](#anchor_1_7)".

(3) Adjust deviation according to the tutorial "[**1.8 Deviation Adjustment**](#anchor_1_8)".

(4) Place the robot on map according to the tutorial "[**1.9.3 Position Calibration**](#anchor_1_9_3)".

* **Whether the picking position needs to be calibrated?** 

(1) Double click  <img style="width:50px" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image16.png"  /> to open PC software.

(2) Click **"Execute"** to enter the editing interface of PC software.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image17.png"  />

(3) Then click **"Read"** in the upper left corner and click **"OK"** to read the initial position information of the gripper.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image18.png"  alt="loading" />

(4) Click **"Run to Coordinate"** to control the robot arm to move to the top of the picking area and observe its position. If the gripper is right at the 1cm above the center of the cross mark in picking area, the position does not need to calibrate, as the figure shown below. If it does not meet the requirements, you need to continue the following steps for calibration.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image19.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(5) If the following deviation situation occurs, as the figure shown below, you need to calibrate the picking position. Thus the following operation steps will calibrate this deviation.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image20.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

* **Calibration Principle**

Take the robot arm as the first person view and take the centre point of the base as the coordinate original point, as the figure shown below.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image6.png"  alt="loading" />

The default initial value of the gripping position is X=1.00cm, Y=14.00cm and Z=0.00cm. The pitch angle is 90 degrees and the running time is 1500ms.
The coordinate value of gripper can be set in the position calibration interface of PC software, as the figure shown below.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image7.png"  alt="loading" />

| Parameter | Function |
|:--:|:--:|
| X | Adjust x-axis value to control the gripper to move left or right. |
| Y | Adjust y-axis value to control the gripper to move forwards and backwards. |
| Z | Adjust z-axis value to control the gripper move up and down. (The z-axis value has been set as 1cm which is a right position for the gripper to stop the middle position between two blocks. It is not commended to modify this value.) |
| Pitch angle | The angle between gripper and x axis, i.e., the angles when the gripper looks upward and downward. This parameter does not need to be modified. |
| Running time | The movement time used by the gripper to move from the previous position to the set coordinate value. (just for checking the running effect ) |
| Read | Read the current position information of gripper. |
| Save | Save the coordinate value of the adjusted gripping position. |
| Run to Coordinate | Click it to move robot arm to the set coordinate value |

* **Calibration Steps**

Observing the following example, you can find that the picking position of gripper is offset upward relative to the cross mark in the picking area of the map, and then we need to adjust it to 1cm directly above the cross mark.

(1) Click **"Read"** button in the lower left corner, and click **"OK"** to read the position information of picking posture.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image8.png"  alt="loading" />

(2) Click **"Run to Coordinate"** to control the gripper to move to the picking area, and observe the offset between the cross mark and the gripper.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image9.png"  alt="loading" />

(3) You can find that the gripper is offset to the right (take robot as the first person view), and the offset distance is close to 0.5cm.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image5.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(4) Therefore, subtract 0.5cm from the x-axis value, that is, the X value is set to **"0.5"**. Then click **"Run to Coordinate"** to see the effect after adjustment.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image10.png"  alt="loading" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image11.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(5) Now, the gripper is very close to the center of the cross mark.

(6) Now let's look at the y-axis. The gripper is offset forward a little bit. In this case, y-axis value needs to be adjusted.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image12.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(7) subtract 0.5cm from they-axis value, that is, the y-axis value is set to **"13.5"**. Then click **"Run to Coordinate"** to see the effect after adjustment.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image13.png"  alt="loading" />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image14.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(8) Now, the gripper is offset to the right a little bit. Therefore, observe and adjust the x-axis value until the centre of the gripper directly above the centre of the cross mark.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_6/image4.jpeg"  alt="loading" />

(9) Because the program has set the z-axis value to 1cm, the gripper is directly above the middle of the two sides of the block, so it is not recommended to modify the values of z-axis and pitch angle.

(10) Then click **"Save"** to save the coordinate value to controller. The gripper will run to this position to pick object next time.
